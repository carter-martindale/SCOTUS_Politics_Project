# SCOTUS_Political_Leanings

This is the working draft for my final project in Gov 50! Essentially, I am trying to visualize the political leanings of various courts over the years, and even predict how certain justices will vote on certain issues. The Working Notes.R and Wrangling.rmd are where I am doing all of my "dirty-work". They were then cleaned up and transferred into various .R files. All of my datasets can be found in raw_data, and the code for my shinyapp can be found in "working_app". Important information regarding different variables can be found in "Variable Notes".
