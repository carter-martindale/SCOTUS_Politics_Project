# SCOTUS_Political_Leanings

This project was my final project in Gov 50, a course I took my Sophomore Fall at Harvard! Essentially, I am trying to visualize the political leanings of various courts over the years, and even predict how certain justices will vote on certain issues. The Wrangling.rmd file is where I did all of my "dirty-work". This was then cleaned up and transferred into various .R files to read into my Shinyapp. All of my datasets can be found in raw_data, and the code for my shinyapp can be found in "working_app". Important information regarding different variables can be found in "Variable Notes". 
Additionally, I first did most of this work in a separate repo, before moving it to this current repo after changing the URL to which my app is deployed. That first repo can be found at https://github.com/carter-martindale/SCOTUS_Political_Leanings
