These are various notes that I first took when studying
the codebook. They aren't very neat, and they have all been 
incorporated into other, more neatly formatted documents by this point.

Notes about the Data:
-Issue Area breaks down all of the issues into larger areas already. So Criminal Procedure = 1, civil rights = 2, 1st amend = 3, due process = 4, privacy = 5, attorney/government fees and compensation = 6, unions = 7, economic activity = 8, judicial power = 9, federalism = 10, interstate relation = 11, federal taxation = 12, misc = 13, private laws = 14
-Specification of direction comports with conventional usage for the most part except for the
interstate relations, private law, and the miscellaneous issues. "Unspecifiable" has been
entered either because the issue does not lend itself to a liberal or conservative description
(e.g., a boundary dispute between two states, real property, wills and estates), or because no
convention exists as to which is the liberal side and which is the conservative side (e.g., the
legislative veto). This variable will also contain "unspecifiable" where one state sues another
under the original jurisdiction of the Supreme Court
-LIberal = 2, Conservative = 1

1 cert
2 appeal
